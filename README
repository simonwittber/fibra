fibra provides a scheduler for cooperative threads, based on Python 
generators. In the context of fibra, generator objects may be referred
to as tasklets.

The plugin system allows the scheduler to grow features, and act as a 
configurable, multipurpose co-routine trampoline.

Plugins:

fibra.plugins.sleep.SleepPlugin
 * allows tasklets to yield a Sleep value, which causes the task to 
 be paused for an amount of time.

fibra.plugins.tasks.TaskPlugin
 * allows tasklets to yield other tasklets, which are then scheduled.
  Also allows tasklets to wait until another tasklet finishes executing,
  or spawn a tasklet when the current tasklet finishes.

fibra.plugins.nonblock.NonBlockPlugin
 * allows a tasklet to momentarily run an iteration in another thread.
 This is useful for running operations which might usually block the
 scheduler and stall other tasklets.
